//cookies are not good for storing sensitive information (ID,password...)
//for that purposes we have session, which is a backend feature.
//Session is also for remembering user data during current session, while cookies can be stored for a lot more time
//Session is storing data on backend and creates a single session for every user, storing in browser cookie only session ID
