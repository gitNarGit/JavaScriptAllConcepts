<!--With local storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.-->
<!--Local storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.-->
<!--Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.-->
<!--All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.-->
<!--localStorage is only available for the same domain
items added to localstorage are never deleted, untill manually deleteing them-->
<!--HTML local storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:

window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)-->

<!--Example-->
<html>
<body>

<div id="result"></div>

<script>
// Check browser support
if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
    // Store
    localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");
    // Retrieve
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("lastname");
} else {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support Web Storage...";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
