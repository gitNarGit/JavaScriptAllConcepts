//Classes are new in JS, but they are not a new way of OOP.
//It is still the same prototype based inheritance model
//classes are just special functions. they are not hoisting
//2 way declaration: named & unnamed
//class MyClass{}
//let MyClass = class{}
//classes are called just as constructor-functions: let x = new MyClass();
//class is always executed in strict mode
//classes dont have properties, they only have methods and props are inside of them.
//when creating object, properties are instantiating to object and methods to it's prototpe
//Example of class
class Books{
  showBooks(){
    console.log("Lots of books");
  };
  showSingleBook(name){
    console.log("You have picked: "+name);
  };
}
let book = new Books();
book.showSingleBook("Call of the wild");
