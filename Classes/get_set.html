//Getters and setters are used to get and set a property. They can also be used in Objcts,Constructors
//classes have no properties, so if we want to access them, we can use getters and setters
//alse for example in modular design pattern, we should hide all properties, and we can open access to them through getters and setters
//for example if we have a property which must always be a number, we can hide it, and allow to change throgh serter, and make additional if statements to prevent adding anything besides number
