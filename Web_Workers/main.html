<!--When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.-->
<!--It's a JS code that is running in the background, and is not blocking other codes-->
<!--Web workers are working from external files and because of that they don't recognize window, document objects
that means that we can't manipulate with DOM in that file-->

<!--Example-->
<!--The example below creates a simple web worker that count numbers in the background-->
<html>
<body>

<p>Count numbers: <output id="result"></output></p>
<button onclick="startWorker()">Start Worker</button> 
<button onclick="stopWorker()">Stop Worker</button>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support Web Workers.</p>

<script>
var w;

function startWorker() {
    if(typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
        if(typeof(w) == "undefined") {
            w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
        }
        w.onmessage = function(event) {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
        };
    } else {
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support Web Workers...";
    }
}

function stopWorker() { 
    w.terminate();
    w = undefined;
}
