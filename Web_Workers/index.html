//Web Workers
//It's a JS code that is running in the background, and is not blocking other codes
//It is running on other threads, making possible a multithreading approach for JS
//It's independent from other codes
//Web workers are working from external files and because of that they don't recognize window, document objects
//that means that we can't manipulate with DOM in that file
//workers can use xmlhttprequest (AJAX)
