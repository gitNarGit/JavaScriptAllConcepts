//The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface,
//that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.
// It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
//The name "Document Object Model" was chosen because it is an "object model" in the traditional object oriented design sense.
//The DOM originated as a specification to allow JavaScript scripts and Java programs to be portable among Web browsers.
