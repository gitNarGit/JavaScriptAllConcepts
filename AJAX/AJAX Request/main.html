<!--To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:-->

<!--xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
xhttp.send();-->

<!--GET or POST?
GET is simpler and faster than POST, and can be used in most cases.

However, always use POST requests when:

1.A cached file is not an option (update a file or database on the server).
2.Sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations).
3.Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters), POST is more robust and secure than GET.-->



<!--Synchronous XMLHttpRequest (async = false) is not recommended because the JavaScript will stop executing until the server response is ready. 
If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop.-->
