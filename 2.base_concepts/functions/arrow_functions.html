// in regular functions this is attached to it's execution context. It is changing it's value depending on how it was called

//first example is inheriting this from it's parent
document.getElementById('af').addEventListener('click', function() {
    let x = 123;
    setTimeout(() => {

//second example gets this of it's caller because setTimeout is the same as window.setTimeout
