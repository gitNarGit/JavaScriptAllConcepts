<!--JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.-->
<!--JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.-->


<!--Sending Data
If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server:-->

<html>
<body>

<h2>Convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string, and send it to the server.</h2>

<script>

var myObj = { "name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York" };
var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;

</script>

</body>
</html>

<!--if we want to send JS data to server, we must use stringify, if we want to use data from server we must use parse-->
<!--JSON is quicker than XML in reading and writing and it can use arrays
JSON is a JS part, so it's ready to be used in JS, and so it's much easier to work with JSON is JS
JSON values can't contain functions, date type and undefined,
but they can be written as strings and converted later. We must avoid from functions in JSON
JSON can be also just an array.It will be parsed to JS array. It's values shoud be as string-->


<!--Receiving Data
If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript object:-->

<html>
<body>

<h2>Convert a string written in JSON format, into a JavaScript object.</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

var myJSON = '{ "name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York" }';
var myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name;

</script>

</body>
</html>
