<!--A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.-->
<!--This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were available.-->
<!--With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.
Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.-->

<!--The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications:-->
<!--For example-->
<html>
<body>

<h1>Getting server updates</h1>
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
    var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php");
    source.onmessage = function(event) {
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
    };
} else {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support server-sent events...";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

<!--Example explained:

Create a new EventSource object, and specify the URL of the page sending the updates (in this example "demo_sse.php")
Each time an update is received, the onmessage event occurs
When an onmessage event occurs, put the received data into the element with id="result"-->

<!--The EventSource Object
In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages. But other events are also available:

Event           Description

onopen	        When a connection to the server is opened
onmessage	    When a message is received
onerror	        When an error occurs-->
