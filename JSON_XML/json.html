//JS Object Notation
//JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
//JSON is a text. It just uses javascript object style
//Because of this, it's easy to transfer JS object to JSON and back

//Syntax
//names in JSON must be in quotes
/*
{
  "name" : "John",
  "surname" : "Smith",
  "f" : "function(){}"
};
JSON.parse()
*/

  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
      console.log(this.responseText.name);//undefined, because JSON is a string
      console.log(JSON.stringify(this.responseText).name); // also undefined, it was a string already
      console.log(JSON.parse(this.responseText).name);//now it's a JS object

//if we want to send JS data to server, we must use stringify, if we want to use data from server we must use parse

//JSON is quicker than XML in reading and writing and it can use arrays
//JSON is a JS part, so it's ready to be used in JS, and so it's much easier to work with JSON is JS
//JSON values can't contain functions, date type and undefined,
//but they can be written as strings and converted later. We must avoid from functions in JSON
//JSON can be also just an array.It will be parsed to JS array. It's values shoud be as string
