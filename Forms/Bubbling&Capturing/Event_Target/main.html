<!--event.target-->

<!--A handler on a parent element can always get the details about where it actually happened.-->
<!--The most deeply nested element that caused the event is called a target element, accessible as event.target.-->

<!--Note the differences from this (=event.currentTarget):

 * event.target – is the “target” element that initiated the event, it doesn’t change through the bubbling process.
 * this – is the “current” element, the one that has a currently running handler on it.-->

<!--For instance, if we have a single handler form.onclick, then it can “catch” all clicks inside the form. No matter where the click happened, it bubbles up to <form> and runs the handler.

In form.onclick handler:

 * this (=event.currentTarget) is the <form> element, because the handler runs on it.
 * event.target is the concrete element inside the form that actually was clicked.-->

  A click shows both <code>event.target</code> and <code>this</code> to compare:

  <form id="form">FORM
    <div>DIV
      <p>P</p>
    </div>
  </form>
