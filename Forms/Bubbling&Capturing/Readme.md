### Bubbling

A click on the inner ```<p>``` first runs onclick:

On that ```<p>```.
Then on the outer ```<div>```.
Then on the outer ```<form>```.
And so on upwards till the document object.

### Capturing

Hereâ€™s the picture of a click on ```<td>``` inside a table, taken from the specification:

That is: for a click on ```<td>``` the event first goes through the ancestors chain down to the element (capturing), then it reaches the target, and then it goes up (bubbles), calling handlers on its way.
